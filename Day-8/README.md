# Terraform Scenarios README

## Scenario 1: Terraform Import

### Overview üèóÔ∏è
In this scenario, we demonstrate how to import existing infrastructure into Terraform.

### Main Content

- **Description:** Terraform allows importing existing resources from cloud providers like AWS into its state management.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Prepare Configuration:** Set up a `main.tf` file with necessary provider configurations.
  2. **Use `terraform import`:** Execute `terraform import` command to import specific resources.
  3. **Debugging Challenges:** Discuss challenges such as missing state files and debugging strategies.

### Example
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  // Import configuration here
}
```

## Scenario 2: Terraform Drift Detection

### Overview üîÑ
This scenario covers how to detect and manage drift in Terraform-managed infrastructure.

### Main Content

- **Description:** Terraform drift occurs when manually edited resources deviate from expected state managed by Terraform.
- **Detection Methods:**
  1. **Using `terraform refresh`:** Implement `terraform refresh` command to detect changes periodically.
  2. **Setting up Audit Logs:** Configure audit logs and use automation (like Lambda functions) to monitor and alert on manual changes.
- **Considerations:** Discuss pros and cons of each method and future deprecation concerns.

### Example

## Conclusion

These scenarios illustrate key concepts in managing infrastructure with Terraform, emphasizing import strategies and drift detection techniques. Practice these scenarios to enhance your Terraform proficiency and prepare for real-world deployment challenges.
