# Welcome to  Interactive Terraform Project!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Welcome to our Terraform project repository. Whether you're new to Terraform or a seasoned pro, you're in the right place to explore and deploy infrastructure as code (IaC).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-project.git
   cd terraform-project
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**: 
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Modify Configuration**: 
   Explore our `main.tf` and `variables.tf` files. Customize configurations based on your requirements.

4. **Plan Your Infrastructure**: 
   Always good practice to see what changes Terraform will apply:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply Changes**: 
   When ready, apply your changes:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Explore Outputs**: 
   After deployment, check the `outputs.tf` file to find useful information like instance IPs or other details.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Our project is organized into reusable modules (`modules/ec2-instance`) for easy scalability.
- **Secure Configuration**: Utilize `terraform.tfrs` for sensitive data like credentials without exposing them in version control.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/your-username/terraform-project/wiki) for detailed guides and best practices.
