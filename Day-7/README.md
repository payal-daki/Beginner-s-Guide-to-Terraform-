This README provides a practical guide to integrating Terraform with HashiCorp Vault for secrets management. Follow these steps to understand how to authenticate with Vault, read secrets, and apply them in a Terraform configuration.

## Prerequisites
- Terraform installed ([Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli))
- HashiCorp Vault instance ([Install Vault](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/getting-started-install))

## Steps

### 1. Configure Vault Authentication
 🛡️ Set up Vault with AppRole authentication method.
 🔑 Generate Role ID and Secret ID.

### 2. Initialize Terraform
🚀 Initialize Terraform with required providers and configurations.

### 3. Read Secrets from Vault
-  🗝️ Use Terraform to read secrets from Vault using data sources.

### 4. Apply Secrets in Terraform Configuration
 📜 Apply retrieved secrets within your Terraform resources.

### 5. Verify Integration
✅ Test and verify if secrets are correctly applied in your infrastructure.

## Example Code Snippet
```hcl
provider "vault" {
  address = "http://vault.example.com"
  skip_ch_token_request = true
}

data "vault_generic_secret" "example" {
  path = "secret/data/test"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0abc123456789def0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
    Secret = data.vault_generic_secret.example.data.username
  }
}
Replace placeholders (vault.example.com, ami-0abc123456789def0, etc.) with your actual values.

Conclusion
By following these steps, you've successfully integrated Terraform with HashiCorp Vault for secrets management. Experiment with different Vault configurations and Terraform resources to further enhance your infrastructure automation.
